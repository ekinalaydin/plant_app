# plant_app

The Plant Disease Detection project will be a mobile application that utilizes image processing and deep learning algorithms to analyze images of plants and detect diseases. The system will provide users accurate information about the disease of plants by analyzing picture of plant which was taken by users by their phones. After detecting the disease our application offers our users a treatment to cure their plants.

These treatments descriptions will be taken from GEMINIAI API. We will store disease descriptions using Google CLOUD. And there will be community form in application. In this form users can share their knowledge with other users by adding post to the community. Users will be able to ask questions in this community and then they can take reply from other users. Moreover, our application will visualize the distribution of the diseases in the whole country on a map. This map will inform users about which diseases occurs most in which location of the country. There will be a login, sign up functions for userâ€™s account. If users want to use this application, they must sign up first. After having an account, they will be able to login to the application. Moreover, user will be able to edit their profile.
